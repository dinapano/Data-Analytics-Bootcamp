"""For this task we will use the famous Fashion MNIST dataset.
The dataset consists of 70000 images (grayscale), where each of them is sized 28x28 pixels. Those images represent 10 different types of clothes, shoes and bags.
Hopefully, this dataset is available within the Τensorflow module and thus it is very easy to load it.

Primary Goals:
In this case study, the primary goal is to develop and evaluate an image classification model using the Fashion MNIST
dataset in TensorFlow's Sequential API. Objectives include defining the problem, preprocessing data, designing
and training the Sequential model, tuning hyperparameters, and analyzing model performance for potential deployment."""
